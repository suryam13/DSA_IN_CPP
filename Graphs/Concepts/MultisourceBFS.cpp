/*
This is same as single source BFS Traversal but here what we do is we put multiple source at once and then keep exploring all the edges 

This is used when we want to find the shortest distance of a node to be reached from nearest neighbour

here we do level order traversal that is we push all the neighours at once and then in the next level we do explore all the ones at once then go to another level 

applications : 
rotten oranges 
map of highest peak
number of encalves
