What is Spanning Tree?
A subgraph which has all the vertices from the main graph and has exactly V-1 edges (such that the graph is a connected graph,means u should be able to go from one edge to any other edge by following a path)
eg : a--b
     |  |
     c--d 
     
     spanning tree :
     a--b       
     |  
     c--d 

     a--b
        |
     c--d 


What is a Minimum Spanning Tree ?
This emphasizes on a directed graph,a spanning tree is a tree with minimum effective overall edge weight,also called as minimum  weight spanning tree

To find minimum spanning tree we have two algorithms :
Prim's
Kruskal
These algo only work for undirected graphs and generally 99% MST is asked for undirected because according to the definition there should be only V-1 edges so that all move freely in order to reach any of the vertex but in directed its not neccessary that we would be able to satisfy these conditions in V-1 edges
