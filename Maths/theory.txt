How is -2 stored?
we take the 2's complement of 2 then we store it in int then it is interpreted as -2
What if we store this in unsigned int ?
the variable wont consider the MSB as the sign instead would consider the entire number to be a big +ve integer 

The hexadecimal representation of a negative number is the same as the hex representation of its corresponding large positive number when stored in an unsigned int.
